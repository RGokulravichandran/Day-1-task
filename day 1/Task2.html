         What are objects in JavaScript?<br>
         In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. 
         Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. 
         A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, 
         which define their characteristics. <br><br>
        Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
        These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s perimitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
        in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
